  Volkswagen was originally established in 1932 by the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) in Berlin.[5] In the early 1930s, the German auto
   industry was still largely composed of luxury models, and the average German could rarely afford anything more than a motorcycle. As a result, only 
   one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent "people's car" projects – the Mercedes 170H, Adler 
   AutoBahn, Steyr 55, and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.
  
  The trend was not new, as Béla Barényi is credited with having conceived the basic design in the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior
   (going as far as advertising it as the "German Volkswagen"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS "Kommissbrot", a small, cheap rear 
   engined car, from 1925 to 1928.[6] Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka's penned Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming 
   smaller and more affordable at each revision. Ferdinand Porsche, a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a
    manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family. He felt the small cars at the time were just stripped down big cars. Instead he built a car he called the
     "Volksauto" from the ground up in 1933, using many of the ideas floating around at the time and several of his own, putting together a 
  car with an air-cooled rear engine, torsion bar suspension, and a "beetle" shape, the front hood rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).

  Volkswagen began introducing an array of new models after Bernd Pischetsrieder
   became Volkswagen Group CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The 
   sixth-generation VW Golf was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia in 
   the 2009 European Car of the Year, and has spawned several cousins: VW Jetta, VW Scirocco, SEAT León,
    SEAT Toledo, Škoda Octavia and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-MPV, the SEAT Altea. The GTI,
     a "hot hatch" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0 L Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct 
     injection engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the U.S. and Canada in 2006.

The sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted
 in 2005, and VW announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the Scirocco by 2008. Other models in Wolfgang
  Bernhard's (Volkswagen brand CEO) "product offensive" include the Tiguan mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a Passat Coupé. In November
   2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO, and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO Martin Winterkorn at the beginning of 2007.


The third generation Volkswagen Scirocco
Volkswagen in 2005 maintained North American sales of 224,195. Momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as VW's North American sales for
 the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales.

The Volkswagen Passat 
In May 2011, Volkswagen completed Chattanooga Assembly in the US state of Tennessee. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars
 and SUVs specifically designed for North American markets, beginning with the Passat B7 in 2011. The company recently announced
  plans to expand further by investing $900 million to add floor space to the factory.

The VW XL1 began a limited production run in 2013. The XL1 is a lightweight and fuel efficient two-person vehicle (only 795 kg).

The Volkswagen Atlas (a large crossover SUV) begins production in late 2016, and aims to help end several years of losses for Volkswagen 
in the US, the world's second-largest auto market.

On 14 September 2016, Volkswagen announced its partnership with three Israeli cybersecurity experts to create a new company, Cymotive, dedicated to automotive security.

VW calls their shift towards electric vehicles "Transform 2025+". As part of the strategy, VW aims to launch more than 30 electric vehicles until
 2025, and is anticipating yearly sales of 2 to 3 million electric VW cars by 2025, which would make up 20 to 25 percent of their total yearly sales
  volume. In September 2017, CEO Matthias Mueller announced plans to have electric version of all of VW's 300 automotive models by 2030.
 The company vows to spend 20 billion euros by 2030 to roll out the cars and designated another 50 billion euros to buy the batteries needed to power the vehicles.

            Ownership Background and History The Logos Supportive Studio was founded in 2015 by Alex Clar and colleagues. A year before, Alex Clar who was working as the staff in the marketing department discovered a big problem in meeting the need of the Logos Supportive Studio in maintaining their first web page to meet the current e-marketing demand on that time. <br><br>Alex Clar later initiated a plan to create Logos’s own sub company which is not only providing graphic design, website creator and advertising consultant service to the main company but also to others as well. </p>

              While it offers benefits and perks like any modern creative company, Logos's is a culture that avoids micromanaging in favor of trusting employees to do their best. Logos products are synonymous with creativity, and only through the avoidance of micromanaging are the people who create those products truly free to create. <br><br>For example, Logos doesn’t use ratings to establish employee capabilities, feeling that that inhibits creativity and harms how teams work.Managers take on the role of a coach, more than anything, letting employees set goals and determine how they should be assessed. Employees are also given stock options so that they know they have both a stake and reward in the company’s success. Continual training and culture that promotes risk taking without fear of penalty are part of Adobe’s open company culture.</p>
